# SFINX Framework

SFINX is a set of program components united by a common philosophy of building Salesforce projects. 
You can use both the entire Framework and its individual modules.

## Quick Start

If you are authorized in any DevHub you can create a Demo org:

```shell
# Create a new demo scratch org
./scripts/create-demo-org.sh sfinx.demo
```

To integrate the framework into your project, you can take either a single module or the entire code from the `src` 
folder.
