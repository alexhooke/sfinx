# SFINX Framework Philosophy

## Author’s Note

SFINX is a framework born from my experience in the technical coordination of nearly a hundred Salesforce projects. 
It was created with one goal in mind: to make development work more intuitive and efficient.

We all appreciate tools that are both user-friendly and well-designed—those that simplify our work rather than 
complicate it with endless documentation and steep learning curves. However, achieving a balance between simplicity 
and technical power is no easy task. SFINX strives to bridge this gap by offering a solution that is accessible 
yet robust.

Tailored for teams with mid-level developers, SFINX is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, allowing 
developers to get started with minimal effort. By providing clear examples and an easy-to-understand structure, even 
those with moderate experience can quickly become productive. Yet, for those who wish to delve deeper, SFINX reveals 
a wealth of advanced features and customization options. This balance between ease of use and technical depth ensures
that the framework is both approachable and powerful, catering to a wide range of skill levels and needs. SFINX is 
more than just a tool; it’s a step toward making Salesforce development smarter, smoother, and more rewarding for 
everyone involved.

## Guiding Principles

The technical design and UI of SFINX Framework is based on the following basic principles:

- **Unified Control**. All modules are managed from a single Salesforce application.

- **External simplicity**. Each module is designed so that any developer can start using it just by looking at 
a short example. At the same time, the internal implementation of the module can be quite complex.

- **Flexibility**. Each module provides opportunities for extension and customization to meet any developers needs.

- **Developer-Centric Design**. Each module and its visual components are crafted with a focus on usability, 
ensuring clear, intuitive, and powerful interfaces. This makes them convenient and efficient tools for developers.
