# SFINX Framework Philosophy

The technical design and UI of SFINX Framework is based on the following basic principles:

- **Unified Control**. All modules are managed from a single Salesforce application.

- **External simplicity**. Each module is designed so that any developer can start using it just by looking at 
a short example. At the same time, the internal implementation of the module can be quite complex.

- **Flexibility**. Each module provides opportunities for extension and customization to meet any developers needs.

- **Developer-Centric Design**. Each module and its visual components are crafted with a focus on usability, 
ensuring clear, intuitive, and powerful interfaces. This makes them convenient and efficient tools for developers.
