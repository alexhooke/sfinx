# SFINX Philosophy

SFINX is based on a few simple principles:

- Simplicity. Easy to learn and use. Each module is designed so that any developer can start using it just by looking 
at a short example.

- Flexibility. Each module provides opportunities for expansion and customization to meet your needs.
